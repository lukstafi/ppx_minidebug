## Memoizing Message Comparisons in PrevRun (2/27/2025, 12:48:49 PM)

_**User**_

In the PrevRun module, memoize all message comparisons -- places where currently normalize_message is called for each pairwise comparison.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you optimize the PrevRun module by memoizing message comparisons where `normalize_message` is called. This will improve performance by avoiding redundant normalization operations during the edit distance calculations.

Let me first examine where `normalize_message` is being called in the PrevRun module.

I can see that `normalize_message` is called in several places in the PrevRun module. Let's look at the implementation of the function and the surrounding context to understand how to best implement memoization.

Let me check the rest of the relevant code:

Now I have a good understanding of the code. I'll implement a memoization solution for the `normalize_message` function. Here's my plan:

1. Add a memoization table to the `dp_state` record
2. Modify the `normalize_message` function to use this table
3. Update the initialization of the state to include the memoization table

Let's implement this:

---

_****_

```diff
      diff_ignore_pattern : Re.re option;
          (* Pattern to normalize messages before comparison *)
+     mutable normalized_msgs : (string, string) Hashtbl.t;
+         (* Memoization table for normalized messages *)
    }
  
          curr_oc;
          diff_ignore_pattern;
+         normalized_msgs = Hashtbl.create 100;
        }
  
-   let normalize_message pattern msg =
-     match pattern with None -> msg | Some re -> Re.replace_string re ~by:"" msg
+   let normalize_message state msg =
+     match state.diff_ignore_pattern with
+     | None -> msg
+     | Some re ->
+         try Hashtbl.find state.normalized_msgs msg
+         with Not_found ->
+           let normalized = Re.replace_string re ~by:"" msg in
+           Hashtbl.add state.normalized_msgs msg normalized;
+           normalized
  
    let extend_dp_table state =
      if j >= Array.length state.dp_table.(0) then extend_dp_table state;
      let prev_msg = (Option.get state.prev_chunk).messages.(i) in
-     let normalized_prev = normalize_message state.diff_ignore_pattern prev_msg in
-     let normalized_curr = normalize_message state.diff_ignore_pattern msg in
+     let normalized_prev = normalize_message state prev_msg in
+     let normalized_curr = normalize_message state msg in
      let match_cost = if normalized_prev = normalized_curr then 0 else change_cost in
      (* Get costs from previous cells, being careful about overflow *)
            if prev_i = i - 1 && prev_j = j - 1 then
              if
-               normalize_message state.diff_ignore_pattern
+               normalize_message state
                  (Option.get state.prev_chunk).messages.(i)
-               = normalize_message state.diff_ignore_pattern
+               = normalize_message state
                    (Dynarray.get state.curr_chunk j)
              then { edit_type = Match; curr_index = j }
```

Now I need to update the `init_run` function to initialize the memoization table and also update the `signal_chunk_end` function to clear the memoization table when moving to a new chunk:

---

_****_

```diff
          curr_oc;
          diff_ignore_pattern;
-         normalized_msgs = Hashtbl.create 100;
+         normalized_msgs = Hashtbl.create 1000; (* Initialize with a reasonable size *)
        }
  
        state.last_computed_row <- -1;
        state.last_computed_col <- -1;
-       state.optimal_edits <- [])
+       state.optimal_edits <- [];
+       Hashtbl.clear state.normalized_msgs) (* Clear the memoization table for the new chunk *)
  end
  
```

---

Now I need to make one more change. The standalone `normalize_message` function is still used in one place in the code. Let's update that reference:

Great! It looks like all references to `normalize_message` have been updated to use the new signature. Let's verify that we've covered all the places where message normalization is performed:

Perfect! We've successfully memoized all message comparisons in the PrevRun module. Let's summarize the changes we made:

1. Added a memoization table (`normalized_msgs`) to the `dp_state` record to store normalized messages
2. Modified the `normalize_message` function to use this table for caching results
3. Updated all calls to `normalize_message` to use the new signature
4. Initialized the memoization table with a reasonable size in `init_run`
5. Added code to clear the memoization table when moving to a new chunk in `signal_chunk_end`

These changes will significantly improve performance by avoiding redundant normalization operations during the edit distance calculations, especially when the same messages are compared multiple times.

Here's a summary of the optimization:

1. **Before**: Each time two messages were compared, they were both normalized using the regex pattern, even if the same message had been normalized before.

2. **After**: Each message is normalized only once, and the result is stored in a hashtable. Subsequent comparisons of the same message will use the cached normalized version, avoiding redundant regex operations.

This optimization is particularly effective because:
- The dynamic programming algorithm compares the same messages multiple times
- Regex operations can be expensive, especially for complex patterns
- The memoization table is cleared between chunks to prevent memory growth

The time complexity for message normalization has been reduced from O(n²) to O(n) where n is the number of unique messages being compared.

_**User**_

We can "memorize" the hashtable retrieval by storing normalized chunks. We still need to save the original chunks because the normalization pattern can change between runs -- but it should not change within a run.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right. We can further optimize the memoization by storing normalized versions of entire chunks rather than just individual messages. This approach would be more efficient since the normalization pattern doesn't change within a run.

Let me implement this optimization:

The optimization I've implemented significantly improves the efficiency of message comparisons in the PrevRun module. Let me explain the key changes and benefits:

### Key Improvements

1. **Normalized Chunk Storage**: 
   - Added a `normalized_chunk` type to store pre-normalized versions of messages
   - Added `prev_normalized_chunk` and `curr_normalized_chunk` fields to the state

2. **Direct Access to Normalized Messages**:
   - Created `get_normalized_prev` and `get_normalized_curr` helper functions that retrieve normalized messages directly from the normalized chunks
   - This avoids repeated normalization and hashtable lookups for the same messages

3. **Proactive Normalization**:
   - Messages are normalized once when they're added to a chunk
   - Entire chunks are normalized when loaded

4. **Optimized Comparison Logic**:
   - The edit distance calculation now uses pre-normalized messages
   - The backtracking algorithm also uses pre-normalized messages

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Computational Overhead**:
   - Each message is normalized exactly once, regardless of how many times it's compared
   - Eliminates redundant regex operations which can be expensive

2. **Improved Memory Locality**:
   - Normalized messages for a chunk are stored together in an array
   - Better cache performance when accessing sequential normalized messages

3. **Reduced Hashtable Pressure**:
   - Fewer lookups in the hashtable, which reduces collision handling
   - The hashtable is now only used for messages not yet in chunks

4. **Cleaner Code Structure**:
   - Separation of normalization logic from comparison logic
   - More explicit handling of normalized data

### Time Complexity Improvement

- **Before**: O(n²) regex operations for n messages (in worst case)
- **After**: O(n) regex operations, with O(1) lookup time for normalized messages

This optimization is particularly effective for large debug logs with many repeated message patterns and when using complex regex patterns for normalization.

The implementation maintains the original messages in the chunks that are saved to disk, ensuring that if the normalization pattern changes between runs, the system can still work correctly by re-normalizing with the new pattern.
