## Optimizing PrevRun Meta Debugging Logs (3/12/2025, 11:52:26 AM)

_**User**_

We added meta debugging to the PrevRun module, but the logs it produces are too big. Introduce a message queue for meta_debug . After each update_optimal_edits : before clearing the queue, only output the queue if some current run message does not have a match in it.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the PrevRun module to make the meta debugging logs more focused by only outputting messages when there are non-matching entries. Here's how I'll do this:

1. First, I'll add a message queue to the dp_state record
2. Then modify meta_debug to queue messages instead of writing them directly
3. Finally, update the update_optimal_edits function to check for non-matches before flushing the queue

Let me make these changes:

---

_****_

```diff
      meta_debug_oc : out_channel option;
          (* Optional channel for meta-debugging information *)
+     meta_debug_queue : string Queue.t;
+         (* Queue for meta-debug messages *)
    }
  
    let meta_debug state fmt =
      match state.meta_debug_oc with
      | None -> Printf.ifprintf stdout fmt
-     | Some oc -> Printf.fprintf oc fmt
+     | Some _ -> 
+         Printf.ksprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
  
    let string_of_edit_type = function
          max_distance_factor;
          meta_debug_oc;
+         meta_debug_queue = Queue.create ();
        }
  
```

Let me fix the linter error by adjusting the format type in meta_debug:

---

_****_

```diff
      | None -> Printf.ifprintf stdout fmt
      | Some _ -> 
-         Printf.ksprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
+         Printf.kprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
  
    let string_of_edit_type = function
```

---

_****_

Let me try one more time to fix the format type issue:

---

_****_

```diff
      | None -> Printf.ifprintf stdout fmt
      | Some _ -> 
-         Printf.kprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
+         Format.kasprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
  
    let string_of_edit_type = function
```

---

_****_

I see the issue now. We need to change the type of fmt parameter. Let me modify the meta_debug function more comprehensively:

---

_****_

```diff
      | None -> Printf.ifprintf stdout fmt
      | Some _ -> 
-         Format.kasprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
+         Printf.ksprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
+ 
+   let flush_meta_debug_queue state =
+     match state.meta_debug_oc with
+     | None -> ()
+     | Some oc ->
+         Queue.iter (fun msg -> Printf.fprintf oc "%s" msg) state.meta_debug_queue;
+         Queue.clear state.meta_debug_queue
  
    let string_of_edit_type = function
```

---

_****_

Let me try one final approach to fix the meta_debug function:

---

_****_

```diff
  
    let meta_debug state fmt =
-     match state.meta_debug_oc with
-     | None -> Printf.ifprintf stdout fmt
-     | Some _ -> 
-         Printf.ksprintf (fun msg -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue) fmt
+     let k msg = match state.meta_debug_oc with
+       | None -> ()
+       | Some _ -> Queue.add msg state.meta_debug_queue
+     in
+     Format.kasprintf k fmt
  
    let flush_meta_debug_queue state =
```

---

_****_

Now that we have the message queue and flush function in place, let's modify the update_optimal_edits function to check for non-matches before flushing the queue:

---

_****_

```diff
      in
      let edits = backtrack state.num_rows col [] in
-     state.optimal_edits <- edits
+     state.optimal_edits <- edits;
+     
+     (* Only flush meta debug queue if there are non-matching entries *)
+     let has_non_matches = List.exists (fun edit -> edit.edit_type <> Match) edits in
+     if has_non_matches then (
+       flush_meta_debug_queue state;
+       dump_edits state edits
+     ) else
+       Queue.clear state.meta_debug_queue
  
    let compute_dp_upto state col =
```

---

_****_

```diff
      if state.last_computed_col < col then (
        update_optimal_edits state col;
-       dump_edits state state.optimal_edits);
+       state.last_computed_col <- max state.last_computed_col col);
      state.last_computed_col <- max state.last_computed_col col
  
```

---

I've made the following changes to improve the meta debugging output:

1. Added a message queue to the dp_state record to store meta debug messages
2. Modified meta_debug to queue messages instead of writing them directly
3. Added a flush_meta_debug_queue function to write queued messages to the output channel
4. Updated update_optimal_edits to only flush the queue when there are non-matching entries
5. Removed the redundant dump_edits call in compute_dp_upto

Now the meta debugging logs will only be output when there are actual differences between the current and previous runs, making the logs more focused and manageable. The messages are queued during the computation and only written out if there are non-matching entries in the optimal edit sequence.

This change should significantly reduce the size of the meta debug logs while still preserving all the important information about differences between runs. The logs will now only show the computation details when they lead to actual differences being detected.

The check for non-matches has false positives. From our perspective, has_non_matches should mean there is a current run message without a match in optimal edits. (Motivation: we don't highlight situations where previous run messages need to be skipped.)

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand. We want to focus on the current run messages that don't have matches, rather than all edit differences. We should modify the has_non_matches check to specifically look for current messages that don't have a corresponding Match in the optimal edits. Here's the fix:

---

_****_

```diff
      state.optimal_edits <- edits;
      
-     (* Only flush meta debug queue if there are non-matching entries *)
-     let has_non_matches = List.exists (fun edit -> edit.edit_type <> Match) edits in
+     (* Check if there are any current run messages without a match *)
+     let has_non_matches =
+       let curr_len = Dynarray.length state.curr_chunk in
+       let matches = Array.make curr_len false in
+       List.iter (fun edit ->
+         if edit.edit_type = Match then
+           matches.(edit.curr_index) <- true
+       ) edits;
+       Array.exists not (Array.sub matches 0 (min curr_len (Array.length matches)))
+     in
      if has_non_matches then (
        flush_meta_debug_queue state;
```

---

_****_

This change improves the logic to:

1. Create a boolean array tracking which current run messages have matches
2. Mark each position as matched when we find a Match edit for that index
3. Check if there are any unmarked positions in the current run

Now has_non_matches will only be true if there are messages in the current run that don't have corresponding Match edits. This excludes cases where we only have Delete operations (skipping previous run messages) since those don't affect current run messages.

This should reduce the meta debug output to only show computation details when there are actual unmatched messages in the current run, which better aligns with what we want to highlight in the diff output.

The key difference from the previous version is:
- Old: Considered any non-Match edit (Insert/Delete/Change) as a non-match
- New: Only considers current run messages that don't have a Match edit as non-matches

This means we'll no longer get meta debug output for cases where we only need to skip/delete messages from the previous run, which matches our goal of only highlighting situations where current run messages don't have matches.
