## Optimizing Minimal Edit Distance Calculation (2/28/2025, 1:13:33 AM)

_**User**_

In the PrevRun approximate minimal edit distance diff finder, for efficiency, compute_dp_upto is centered around the diagonal. min_cost_for_row is currently unused. Instead of centering around the diagonal, remember the last processed row's minimal cost column and center the exploration of the next row around it.

I'll help you implement this optimization for the `compute_dp_upto` function in the PrevRun approximate minimal edit distance diff finder. Instead of centering around the diagonal, we'll modify the code to remember the last processed row's minimal cost column and center the exploration of the next row around it.

Let me first search for the relevant code to understand the current implementation.

Now I understand the current implementation. Let me modify the `compute_dp_upto` function to remember the last processed row's minimal cost column and center the exploration of the next row around it, instead of centering around the diagonal.

I've successfully implemented the optimization for the `compute_dp_upto` function in the PrevRun approximate minimal edit distance diff finder. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Added a new field to the `dp_state` type:
   - `min_cost_cols`: A hashtable that maps row indices to the column with the minimum cost for that row

2. Updated the `init_run` function to initialize the new `min_cost_cols` hashtable

3. Modified the `compute_dp_upto` function to:
   - For each new row, center the exploration around the minimum cost column from the previous row (if available)
   - Track the column with the minimum cost for each row as it's processed
   - Update the `min_cost_cols` hashtable with this information
   - Use this information to guide the exploration of subsequent rows

4. Updated the `signal_chunk_end` function to clear the `min_cost_cols` hashtable when a chunk ends

This optimization should improve the efficiency of the diff finder by focusing the exploration on the most promising areas of the dynamic programming table. Instead of always centering around the diagonal, it now adaptively centers around the column that had the minimum cost in the previous row, which is likely to be closer to the optimal path.

The implementation now makes use of the previously unused `min_cost_for_row` variable, tracking not just the minimum cost but also the column where that minimum cost was found. This information is then used to guide the exploration in subsequent rows.
