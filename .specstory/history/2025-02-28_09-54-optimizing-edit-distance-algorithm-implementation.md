## Optimizing Edit Distance Algorithm Implementation (2/28/2025, 9:54:23 AM)

_**User**_

When optimizing the PrevRun approximate minimal edit distance diff finder, I got confused and structured the optimization wrongly. compute_dp_upto is used with a constant row (the size of the previous run's chunk) and an incrementally growing col . But the lossy optimization for centered search assumes usage with a constant col and an incrementally growing row. However, we cannot simply switch from min_cost_cols to min_cost_rows . We need to transpose the whole implementation of compute_dp_upto to do outer iterations on columns.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is describing an issue with their optimization strategy for a function called `compute_dp_upto` which is part of a diff-finding algorithm that calculates minimal edit distance. Let me understand the problem:

1. The current `compute_dp_upto` assumes it will be called with a growing row index and a fixed column index.
2. But in reality, it's called with a fixed row index and a growing column index.
3. The optimization strategy (centered search with min_cost_cols) is therefore not working correctly.
4. We need to transpose the entire implementation to iterate over columns in the outer loop instead of rows.

This is essentially a dynamic programming problem for edit distance calculation, and the optimization being attempted is to focus the search around a "center" where the minimal edits are likely to occur (a common optimization for edit distance algorithms).

I should first explore the codebase to better understand the current implementation, then propose a solution to transpose the algorithm.</think>I understand the issue. Your optimization strategy is misaligned with how the function is actually used. Let me examine the current implementation to understand how best to transpose it.

Based on my analysis, I now understand the problem clearly. Let me create a transposed version of the `compute_dp_upto` function, adapting it to iterate over columns in the outer loop and rows in the inner loop.

I need to fix the linter errors, particularly regarding the state structure. Let me first check the state structure to see if it already includes `min_cost_rows` field:

Now let me fix the code with the correct approach:

---

```diff
      min_cost_cols : (int, int) Hashtbl.t;
          (* Row index -> column with minimum cost *)
+     mutable min_cost_rows : (int, int) Hashtbl.t;
+         (* Column index -> row with minimum cost *)
    }
  
          min_cost_cols = Hashtbl.create 1000;
          (* Track min cost column for each row *)
+         min_cost_rows = Hashtbl.create 1000;
+         (* Track min cost row for each column *)
        }
  
        state.optimal_edits <- [];
        Hashtbl.clear state.normalized_msgs;
-       Hashtbl.clear state.min_cost_cols)

Now I need to fix the `compute_dp_upto` implementation to correctly use the state structure:

Perfect! I've successfully transposed the `compute_dp_upto` function to work column-first instead of row-first. Let me explain the changes:

1. Added a new field `min_cost_rows` to the `dp_state` type to track the minimum cost row for each column.

2. Modified the `compute_dp_upto` function to:
   - Iterate over columns in the outer loop and rows in the inner loop
   - Find the center row for each column (instead of center column for each row)
   - Track and update the minimum cost row for each column in `state.min_cost_rows`

These changes align with how the function is actually used in your code - with a constant row (the size of the previous run's chunk) and an incrementally growing column.

The optimization now correctly assumes a column-first approach:
- It performs adaptive pruning centered around the minimum cost row for each column
- It gradually expands outward from this center point by `max_distance_factor`
- It keeps track of which rows have minimum costs for each column to guide future explorations

This transposition should solve the issue where your current optimization strategy was misaligned with the actual usage pattern of the function.
