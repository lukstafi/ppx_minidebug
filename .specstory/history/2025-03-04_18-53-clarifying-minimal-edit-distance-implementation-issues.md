## Clarifying Minimal Edit Distance Implementation Issues (3/4/2025, 6:53:37 PM)

_**User**_

Help me understand the minimal edit distance algorithm as implemented in PrevRun . There's something I find fishy in how we maintain the optimal edits path, and more generally in the semantics of the Delete explanation. I thought the choices are: match current message with previous run message at given positions as same, match them as changed, insert current message (advance current run position), delete previous run message (advance previous run position). If I get this right, then there's a bug in update_optimal_edits -- and if there's no bug, it's still confusing that the update for j < 0 puts the previous run position under curr_index .

<think>Let's analyze the edit distance implementation in this code to understand what's happening and identify any potential issues.

First, I'll recap what a minimal edit distance algorithm typically does:

1. It compares two sequences (like strings, arrays, etc.) and computes the minimum number of operations required to transform one sequence into another.
2. The operations usually include:
   - Match: when elements at current positions are identical
   - Change/Replace: when an element in sequence 1 is changed to an element in sequence 2
   - Insert: when an element from sequence 2 is inserted
   - Delete: when an element from sequence 1 is deleted

The implementation uses dynamic programming, with a table that tracks the minimum cost to transform the prefix of one sequence into the prefix of another.

Let's look specifically at the `update_optimal_edits` function which is the source of confusion:

```ocaml
let update_optimal_edits state row col =
  (* Backtrack through dp table to find optimal edit sequence *)
  let rec backtrack i j acc =
    if i < 0 && j < 0 then acc
    else if i < 0 then
      let edit = { edit_type = Insert; curr_index = j } in
      backtrack i (j - 1) (edit :: acc)
    else if j < 0 then
      let edit = { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = i } in
      backtrack (i - 1) j (edit :: acc)
    else
      let _cost, prev_i, prev_j = get_dp_value state i j in
      let edit =
        if prev_i = i - 1 && prev_j = j - 1 then
          let normalized_prev = get_normalized_prev state i in
          if normalized_prev = get_normalized_curr state j then
            { edit_type = Match; curr_index = j }
          else { edit_type = Change normalized_prev; curr_index = j }
        else if prev_i = i - 1 then { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = j }
        else { edit_type = Insert; curr_index = j }
      in
      backtrack prev_i prev_j (edit :: acc)
  in
  let edits = backtrack row col [] in
  state.optimal_edits <- edits
```

The user's concern is primarily about the `Delete` case and specifically when `j < 0`:

```ocaml
else if j < 0 then
  let edit = { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = i } in
  backtrack (i - 1) j (edit :: acc)
```

The user is confused about why `curr_index` is set to `i` in this case. Let's clarify the semantics here:

1. `i` typically represents the position in the "previous run" or "source" sequence
2. `j` typically represents the position in the "current run" or "target" sequence

When `j < 0`, it means we've exhausted the current sequence but still have elements in the previous sequence. These elements from the previous sequence need to be deleted to complete the transformation.

Looking at the field name `curr_index`, it seems to suggest it should point to positions in the "current run" sequence, which would be indices in `j`. But in the `Delete` case when `j < 0`, it's using `i` which is from the "previous run".

This is indeed confusing and might be a bug. Let's also look at the other case in the main part of the function:

```ocaml
else if prev_i = i - 1 then { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = j }
```

Here, when identifying a delete operation during normal backtracking, `curr_index` is set to `j`. 

So we have an inconsistency:
- When `j < 0`, `Delete` operations use `i` for `curr_index`
- In the normal case, `Delete` operations use `j` for `curr_index`

This definitely seems problematic. Either both should use `i` (if `curr_index` for `Delete` is meant to indicate which element from the previous run is being deleted) or both should use `j` (if `curr_index` is always meant to point to the current position in the target sequence).

Given the semantics of edit distance, the most likely intention is that:
1. For `Insert`: `curr_index` should point to the position in the current sequence that is being inserted
2. For `Delete`: `curr_index` should point to the position in the previous sequence that is being deleted
3. For `Match`/`Change`: `curr_index` should point to the position in the current sequence that is being matched/changed

If that's the case, then the line:
```ocaml
else if prev_i = i - 1 then { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = j }
```
is incorrect and should be:
```ocaml
else if prev_i = i - 1 then { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = i }
```

The user's confusion is justified, and there seems to be an inconsistency or bug in how `curr_index` is used for `Delete` operations.</think># Understanding the Edit Distance Algorithm Implementation

You're right to question this implementation - there's indeed a confusing inconsistency in how the `curr_index` field is used in the `Delete` case.

## The Core Issue

In a standard edit distance algorithm, we typically have these operations:
- **Match**: Elements at current positions are identical
- **Change**: Replace an element in sequence 1 with an element in sequence 2
- **Insert**: Add an element from sequence 2
- **Delete**: Remove an element from sequence 1

In this implementation:
- `i` indexes the previous run (source sequence)
- `j` indexes the current run (target sequence)

## The Inconsistency

Looking at the `Delete` operation handling:

1. When `j < 0` (lines 686-688):
```ocaml:minidebug_runtime.ml
else if j < 0 then
  let edit = { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = i } in
  backtrack (i - 1) j (edit :: acc)
```

2. But in the main backtracking logic (line 697):
```ocaml:minidebug_runtime.ml
else if prev_i = i - 1 then { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = j }
```

These are inconsistent! In one case `curr_index` is set to `i` (the previous run position being deleted), and in the other it's set to `j` (the current run position).

## What's Correct?

For a `Delete` operation, the semantic meaning is "delete an element from the previous run." So `curr_index` should consistently refer to the position in the previous run that's being deleted (which would be `i`).

The line 697 appears to be incorrect - it should use `i` instead of `j` for consistency with the meaning of `Delete` and with how it's handled in the edge case.

## The Fix

The line:
```ocaml
else if prev_i = i - 1 then { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = j }
```

Should likely be:
```ocaml
else if prev_i = i - 1 then { edit_type = Delete; curr_index = i }
```

This confusion arises from mixing the semantics of what `curr_index` represents. If it's meant to always index into the current run, then the edge case is wrong. If it's meant to index into the relevant sequence for each operation type, then the main case is wrong.

Given the edge case implementation and the semantics of edit operations, it seems more likely that the intention was for `curr_index` in a `Delete` to point to the previous run element being deleted, making line 697 the buggy part.

@Web Are you confident that the minimal edit distance operations are typically like in point 2 of your thinking process, not just in our implementation?

_**Assistant**_

<think>Let me double-check the standard definitions of edit distance operations by reviewing the Wikipedia information provided. 

From the Wikipedia article on edit distance, the common algorithm describes the Wagner-Fischer algorithm for computing edit distance. It defines three main operations:

1. Deletion: Remove an element from the first sequence (a_i)
2. Insertion: Add an element from the second sequence (b_j)
3. Substitution: Replace an element in the first sequence with an element from the second sequence

This is shown in the recurrence relation where:
- d_{i-1,j} + w_del(a_i) represents deletion
- d_{i,j-1} + w_ins(b_j) represents insertion
- d_{i-1,j-1} + w_sub(a_i,b_j) represents substitution

And when a_i = b_j, we just have d_{i-1,j-1} (no edit needed, elements match).

This aligns with the common understanding of edit distance operations, so yes, I'm confident that my description of the standard operations is correct. The typical operations in an edit distance algorithm are:

1. Match: Elements are identical (no edit needed)
2. Change/Substitute: Replace an element in sequence 1 with an element in sequence 2
3. Insert: Add an element from sequence 2
4. Delete: Remove an element from sequence 1

This matches what I described in my previous response. The issue I identified with the code is that there's an inconsistency in how it treats the "curr_index" field for the Delete operation - sometimes it uses the index from the first sequence (i), and sometimes it uses the index from the second sequence (j), which is inconsistent with the semantics of a deletion operation.</think>Yes, I'm confident that the standard edit distance operations are as I described. Looking at the Wagner-Fischer algorithm from the Wikipedia article on edit distance, the three main operations are clearly defined:

1. **Delete**: Remove an element from the first sequence (a_i) - represented by d_{i-1,j} + w_del(a_i)
2. **Insert**: Add an element from the second sequence (b_j) - represented by d_{i,j-1} + w_ins(b_j)
3. **Substitute/Change**: Replace an element in the first sequence with an element from the second sequence - represented by d_{i-1,j-1} + w_sub(a_i,b_j)

And the fourth case is when elements match (a_i = b_j), which requires no edit.

In the standard formulation of the edit distance problem, these operations have clear semantic meanings:
- Deletion refers to removing an element from the source sequence
- Insertion refers to adding an element from the target sequence
- Substitution refers to replacing an element in the source with one from the target

The confusion in the implementation appears when the semantics of `curr_index` aren't consistent. For a deletion operation, it should logically refer to the position in the source sequence (previous run in your case) that's being removed, not the position in the target sequence.

[Wikipedia: Edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) confirms this understanding in its description of how the algorithm works and how backtracing is performed to reconstruct the edit sequence.
