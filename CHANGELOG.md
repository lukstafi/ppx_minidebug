## [0.4.0] -- current

### Added

-- The `PrintBox` logger now allows disabling (not outputting) a whole subtree of the logs.

## [0.3.3] -- 2023-09-15

### Changed

-- Breaking change: explicitly set whether logs should be time tagged.

## [0.3.2] -- 2023-04-25

### Fixed

-- Missing version bounds on `ocaml` and `ppxlib` to make CI happy.

## [0.3.1] -- 2023-03-30

### Fixed

- A small tweak to have `dune-release` work.

## [0.3.0] -- 2023-03-29

### Changed

- Breaking change: renamed `Minidebug_runtime.Format` to `Minidebug_runtime.PP_format`.
- Non-optionally depending on `sexplib0` and `ppx_sexp_conv`, as optional dependency was making it hard to test. Also the `minidebug_runtime` source files duplication was ugly.
- Trying to minimize dependencies: removed the unused direct dependency on `base`, but `ppx_sexp_conv` depends on it. Removed the dependency on `stdio`.
- Added a building-related comment to the documentation.

## [0.2.0] -- 2023-03-29

### Fixed

- Added non-optional package dependencies.
- Major bug fix: missing processing of the top expression in a function body.

## [0.1.4] -- 2023-03-21

### Changed

- Merged the two packages `ppx_minidebug` and `minidebug_runtime` into one.

## [0.1.3] -- 2023-03-17

### Fixed

- Handles labeled function arguments.

### Added

- Documentation suggestions regarding [VOCaml](https://github.com/lukstafi/vocaml).

## [0.1.2] -- 2023-03-06

### Added

- A syntax extension to instrument type-annotated bindings and functions with logging.
- The extension supports 3 value conversion mechanisms: pp and show from deriving.show, and sexp from ppx_sexp_conv.
- The `minidebug_runtime` package provides 3 logging backends: Format based purely on formatters, Flushing that converts to strings first and flushes output after every entry, and PrintBox that pretty-prints as trees using the printbox package.
- References a VS Code extension that builds flame graphs for the `Flushing` logger out-of-the-box.
- Documentation and API docs on github.io.
- Tests, including testing the writing-to-files functionality. Uses `sed` for sanitizing.
