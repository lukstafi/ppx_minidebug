Testing sexp structure for tree type:

Leaf 5:
(Leaf 5)

Node ("root", [Leaf 1; Leaf 2]):
(Node root ((Leaf 1) (Leaf 2)))

Node ("parent", [Node ("child", [Leaf 1; Leaf 2]); Leaf 3]):
(Node parent ((Node child ((Leaf 1) (Leaf 2))) (Leaf 3)))

shared_subtree:
(Node shared
 ((Leaf 1) (Leaf 2) (Node nested ((Leaf 3) (Leaf 4) (Leaf 5))) (Leaf 6)
  (Leaf 7)))
