 |### `values_first_mode`
 |
 |This setting, by default `true`, puts the result of the computation as the header of a computation subtree, rather than the source code location of the computation. I recommend using this setting as it reduces noise and makes the important information easier to find and visible with less unfolding. Another important benefit is that it makes hyperlinks usable, by pushing them from the summary line to under the fold. It is the default setting, but can be disabled by passing `~values_first_mode:false` to runtime builders, because it can be confusing: the logs are no longer ordered by computation time. It is not available in the `_flushing` runtimes.
 |
 |For example, the diffs example we saw before:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_debug_timestamps.ml,part=ignore_timestamps_setup -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let _get_local_debug_runtime =
+|    Minidebug_runtime.local_runtime ~values_first_mode:false ~backend:`Text
+|      ~prev_run_file:"debugger_timestamps_run1.raw"
+|      ~diff_ignore_pattern:(Re.Pcre.re {|\[\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\]|})
+|      "debugger_timestamps_run2"
+|  in
 |```
 |
 |leads to:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/debugger_timestamps_run2.expected.log -->
 |```
+|BEGIN DEBUG SESSION 
+|"test/test_debug_timestamps.ml":23:33: process_message

 |When logging uses sexps and boxification, and the result is decomposed into a subtree, only the header of the result subtree is put in the header line, and the rest of the result subtree is just underneath it with a `<returns>` or a `<values>` header. Example showcasing the `printbox-html` backend:

 |## Usage
 |
 |Tracing only happens in explicitly marked lexical scopes. For extension points applied directly to bindings (let-definitions) only the `let` definition in scope for logging, the body of the definition(s) is considered outside the extension point. (But if the extension is over an expression with a nested let-binding, the body of the definition is in the scope of the extension.)
 |
 |The entry extension points vary along three axes:
 |
 |- `%debug_` vs. `%track_` vs. `%diagn_`
 |  - The prefix `%debug_` means logging fewer things: only let-bound values and functions are logged, and functions only when either: directly in a `%debug_`-annotated let binding, or their return type is annotated.
File "README.md", line 301, characters 0-1:
 |See examples in [the test directory](test/), and especially [the inline tests](test/test_expect_test.ml).
 |
 |Only type-annotated let-bindings, function arguments, function results can be implicitly logged. However, the bindings and function arguments can be nested patterns with only parts of them type-annotated! The explicit loggers `%log` and `%log_result` take a value and reconstruct its type from partial type annotations (deconstructing the expression), sometimes assuming unknown types are strings. The `%log_printbox` logger takes a `PrintBox.t` value. The `%log_entry` and `%log_block` loggers takes a string value for the header of the log subtree.
 |
 |To properly trace in concurrent settings, ensure that different threads use different log channels. For example, you can bind `Debug_runtime` locally: `let module Debug_runtime = Minidebug_runtime.debug_file thread_name in ...` Extension points with the `_l_` or `_rt_` infixes are a great help for that, e.g. `%debug_l_sexp`; see: [Dealing with concurrent execution](#dealing-with-concurrent-execution).
 |
 |To ensure that log files are properly closed, you can use `Minidebug_runtime.finish_and_cleanup` at the end. This is typically not needed (and is more helpful on Windows, where a log file might remain locked after a process exits without closing it).
 |
 |`ppx_minidebug` can be installed using `opam`. `ppx_minidebug.runtime` depends on `printbox`, `ptime`, `mtime`, `sexplib0`.
 |
 |### Breaking infinite recursion with `max_nesting_depth` and looping with `max_num_children`; flushing-based traces
 |
 |PrintBox-based runtimes only produces any output when a top-level log entry gets closed. This makes it harder to debug infinite loops and especially infinite recursion. The setting `max_nesting_depth` terminates a computation when the given log nesting is exceeded. For example:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=debug_interrupts -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let _get_local_debug_runtime =
+|    Minidebug_runtime.prefixed_runtime ~values_first_mode:false ()
+|  in
+|  let%debug_show rec loop_exceeded (x : int) : int =
+|    [%debug_interrupts
+|      { max_nesting_depth = 5; max_num_children = 1000 };
+|      let z : int = (x - 1) / 2 in
+|      if x <= 0 then 0 else z + loop_exceeded (z + (x / 2))]
+|  in
+|  let () =
+|    try print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ loop_exceeded 7
+|    with _ -> print_endline "Raised exception."
+|  in
+|  [%expect
+|    {|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION
+|    "test/test_expect_test.ml":332:35: loop_exceeded
+|    ├─x = 7
+|    ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":335:10: z
+|    │ └─z = 3
+|    └─"test/test_expect_test.ml":332:35: loop_exceeded
+|      ├─x = 6
+|      ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":335:10: z
+|      │ └─z = 2
+|      └─"test/test_expect_test.ml":332:35: loop_exceeded
+|        ├─x = 5
+|        ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":335:10: z
+|        │ └─z = 2
+|        └─"test/test_expect_test.ml":332:35: loop_exceeded
+|          ├─x = 4
+|          ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":335:10: z
+|          │ └─z = 1

+|              └─z = <max_nesting_depth exceeded>
+|    Raised exception.
+|    |}]
 |```
 |
 |Similarly, `max_num_children` raises a failure when the given number of logs with the same parent is exceeded. For example:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=debug_limit_children -->
 |```ocaml
+|    let module Debug_runtime = (val _get_local_debug_runtime ()) in
+|    try
+|      let%debug_o_show _bar : unit =
+|        [%debug_interrupts
+|          { max_nesting_depth = 1000; max_num_children = 10 };
+|          for i = 0 to 100 do
+|            let _baz : int = i * 2 in
+|            ()
+|          done]
+|      in
+|      ()
+|    with Failure s -> print_endline @@ "Raised exception: " ^ s
+|  in
+|  [%expect
+|    {|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION
+|    "test/test_expect_test.ml":377:23: _bar
+|    ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":381:16: _baz
+|    │ └─_baz = 0
+|    ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":381:16: _baz

+|    └─_baz = <max_num_children exceeded>
+|    Raised exception: ppx_minidebug: max_num_children exceeded
+|    |}]
 |```
 |
 |The `%debug_interrupts` extension point emits the interrupt checks in a lexically delimited scope. For convenience, we offer the extension point `%global_debug_interrupts` which triggers emitting the interrupt checks in the remainder of the source preprocessed in the same process (its scope is therefore less well defined). For example:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_debug_interrupts.ml,part=global_debug_interrupts -->
 |```ocaml
+|module Debug_runtime =
+|  (val Minidebug_runtime.debug_flushing ~filename:"debugger_show_interrupts" ())
+|
+|[%%global_debug_interrupts { max_nesting_depth = 5; max_num_children = 10 }]
+|[%%global_debug_type_info true]
+|
+|let%debug_o_show rec loop_exceeded (x : int) : int =
+|  let z : int = (x - 1) / 2 in
+|  if x <= 0 then 0 else z + loop_exceeded (z + (x / 2))
 |```
 |
 |If that is insufficient, you can define `_get_local_debug_runtime` using a `_flushing` builder. The logged traces are still indented, but if the values to print are multi-line, their formatting might be messy. The benefit of "flushing" traces is that the output is flushed line-at-a-time, so no output should be lost if the traced program crashes. But in recent versions of `ppx_minidebug`, uncaught exceptions no longer break logging. The indentation is also smaller (half of the PrintBox runtimes). Example:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=simple_flushing -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let _get_local_debug_runtime =
+|    Minidebug_runtime.prefixed_runtime_flushing ~time_tagged:Not_tagged
+|      ~global_prefix:"test-51" ()
+|  in
+|  let%debug_show bar (x : t) : int =
+|    let y : int = x.first + 1 in
+|    x.second * y
+|  in
+|  let () = print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ bar { first = 7; second = 42 } in
+|  let%debug_show baz (x : t) : int =
+|    let ((y, z) as _yz) : int * int = (x.first + 1, 3) in
+|    (x.second * y) + z
+|  in
+|  let () = print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ baz { first = 7; second = 42 } in
+|  let output = [%expect.output] in
+|  print_endline output;
+|  [%expect
+|    {|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION test-51
+|    test-51 bar begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":157:21:
+|     x = { Test_expect_test.first = 7; second = 42 }
+|     test-51 y begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":158:8:
+|      y = 8
+|     test-51 y end
+|     bar = 336
+|    test-51 bar end
+|    336
+|    test-51 baz begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":162:21:

+|      _yz = (8, 3)
+|     test-51 _yz end
+|     baz = 339
+|    test-51 baz end
+|    339
+|    |}]
 |```

 |### Tracking: control flow branches, anonymous and insufficiently annotated functions
 |
 |Using the `%track_`-prefix rather than `%debug_`-prefix to start a debug scope, or using the `%debug_trace` extension point inside a debug scope, enables more elaborate tracking of the execution path. It logs which `if`, `match`, `function` branch is taken. It logs the nesting and loop index of `for` loops, and the nesting of `while` loops. It logs functions even if the return type is not annotated, including anonymous functions; in particular, it logs type-annotated arguments of anonymous functions. To selectively disable these logs, use `%debug_notrace`. Note that it disables the logs on a lexical scope, not just on the annotated syntax node (e.g. a specific `if` or `match` expression).
 |
 |If you get fewer logs than you expected, try converting `%debug_` to `%track_`.
 |
 |Example that also illustrates disabling tracing:
 |
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=track_notrace_example -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let _get_local_debug_runtime =
+|    Minidebug_runtime.prefixed_runtime ~values_first_mode:false ()
+|  in
+|  let%track_show track_branches (x : int) : int =
+|    if x < 6 then
+|      match%debug_notrace x with
+|      | 0 -> 1
+|      | 1 -> 0
+|      | _ ->
+|          let result : int = if x > 2 then x else ~-x in
+|          result
+|    else
+|      match x with
+|      | 6 -> 5
+|      | 7 -> 4
+|      | _ ->
+|          let result : int = if x < 10 then x else ~-x in
+|          result
+|  in
+|  let () =
+|    try
+|      print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ track_branches 8;
+|      print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ track_branches 3
+|    with _ -> print_endline "Raised exception."
+|  in
+|  [%expect
+|    {|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION

+|    |}]
 |```
 |
 |Another example:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=track_anonymous_example -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let%track_show anonymous (x : int) =
+|    Array.fold_left ( + ) 0 @@ Array.init (x + 1) (fun (i : int) -> i)

+|      └─i = 3
+|    6
+|    |}]
 |```
 |
 |To disable, rather than enhance, debugging for a piece of code, you can use the `%diagn_` extension points.
 |
 |Explicit logging statements also help with tracking the execution, since they can be placed anywhere within a debug scope. Example from the test suite:

 |### Using as a logging framework
 |
 |`ppx_minidebug` can be used as a logging framework: its annotations can be stored permamently with the source code, rather than shyly added for a brief period of debugging. To allow this, there needs to be a mechanism of logging levels -- otherwise the system is slowed down too much, or even if performance is not an issue, the user is overwhelmed with the amount of logs. `ppx_minidebug` addresses these issues in a flexible way, by offering restriction of log levels both at compile time and at runtime.
 |
 |The `%diagn_` extension points (short for "diagnostic") are tailored for the "logging framework" use-case. Within the scope of a `%diagn_` extension point, only explicit logs are generated. Therefore, one can freely add type annotations without generating debug logs. As a side-effect, `%diagn_` annotations can be used to disable debugging for pieces of code where we need type annotations for code reasons, but do not have serialization/printing functions for the types.
 |
 |In the `PrintBox` backend, logs accumulate until the current toplevel log scope is closed. This is unfortunate in the logging framework context, where promptly informing the user using the logs might be important. To remedy this, `PrintBox_runtime` offers the setting `snapshot_every_sec`. When set, if sufficient time has passed since the last output, the backend will output the whole current toplevel log scope. If possible, the previous snapshot of the same log scope is erased, to not duplicate information. The underlying mechanism is available as [snapshot] in the generic interface; it does nothing in the flushing backend. [snapshot] is useful when there's a risk of a "premature" exit of the debugged program or thread.
 |
 |The log levels are integers intended to be within the range 0-9, where 0 means no logging at all. They can be provided explicitly by all extension entry points and all explicit logging extensions. When omitted, the log level of the enclosing log entry is used; the default for a top-level log entry is log level 1. The syntax for logging at a compile-time given level is by example: `%debug2_sexp` (log at level 2), `%log3` (log at level 3), `%log1_resut` (log result at level 1), `%diagn3_sexp` (log at level 3) etc.
 |
 |The `%diagn_` extension points further restrict logging to explicit logs only. Example from the test suite:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=diagn_show_ignores_bindings -->
 |```ocaml

 |At runtime creation, the level can be set via the `~log_level` parameter, or via `Debug_runtime.log_level := ...` later on, also for the flushing backend. The following example also illustrates the `_rt_` runtime-passing entry points:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=log_runtime_log_levels_while_loop_example -->
 |```ocaml

 |But there is a more convenient approach. Both at compile time (constant) and at runtime (integer expression), the level can be set for a scope with `%log_level`, or globally with `%global_debug_log_level`. (`%log_level` is not registered to minimize incompatibility with other logging frameworks.) The (default) compile-time level can also be set silently via the environment variable `PPX_MINIDEBUG_DEFAULT_COMPILE_LOG_LEVEL` (unsafe). The extensions `%global_debug_log_level`, `%log_level` set the compile time log level only when used with an integer literal, otherwise they are limited to setting the runtime log level.
 |
 |For example:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_debug_log_prefixed.ml,part=global_debug_log_level -->
 |```ocaml
+|let _get_local_debug_runtime =
+|  Minidebug_runtime.local_runtime_flushing "debugger_show_log_prefixed"
+|
+|[%%global_debug_log_level 2]
+|
+|let%diagn_show rec loop_exceeded (x : int) : int =
+|  let z : int =
+|    [%log2 "inside loop", (x : int)];
+|    [%log3 "this is detail"];
+|    (x - 1) / 2
+|  in
+|  if x <= 0 then 0 else z + loop_exceeded (z + (x / 2))
 |```
 |
 |This will not emit logging code that is above the stated log level. Note that the compile-time pruning of logging happens independently of the runtime log level! This gives more flexibility but can lead to confusing situations.
 |
 |Currently `%log_level` adjusts the log level both in the lexical scope and the dynamic scope. These functionalities could in principle be separated.
 |
 |You can set the compile time log level by setting the environment variable `PPX_MINIDEBUG_DEFAULT_COMPILE_LOG_LEVEL` -- this provides a default that will be overriden by all the other configuration options. This approach is error prone since all your projects and files will share the same configuration, and there is no consistency checking; use at your own risk. Some errors can be avoided by adding `(preprocessor_deps (env_var PPX_MINIDEBUG_DEFAULT_COMPILE_LOG_LEVEL))` in dune files.
 |
 |There's also a way to compile the code adaptively, using any shell environment variable: `[%%global_debug_log_level_from_env_var "environment_variable_name"]`. The variable name is case-sensitive, the values should be integers. I recommend configuring this in every affected file, otherwise the behavior is unspecified.
 |
 |With `[%%global_debug_log_level_from_env_var "environment_variable_name"]`, the generated code will check that the compile-time adaptive pruning matches the runtime value of the environment variable. If that's an obstacle, use `%%global_debug_log_level_from_env_var_unsafe` which will not perform the check. Using `%%global_debug_log_level_from_env_var_unsafe` or `PPX_MINIDEBUG_DEFAULT_COMPILE_LOG_LEVEL` can be prone to workflow bugs where different parts of a codebase are compiled with different log levels, leading to confusing behavior. In any case, I recommend adding a dependency on the environment variable to the `dune` file: for libraries, that would be `(preprocessor_deps (env_var environment_variable_name))`.
 |
 |Another example from the test suite, notice how the log level of `%log1` overrides the parent log level of `%debug3_show`:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=debug_show_log_level_runtime -->

 |The extension point `%log_result` lets you benefit from the `values_first_mode` setting even when using only explicit logs. Conveying more information in headers lets you explore logs more quickly.

 |The extension point `%log_entry` lets you shape arbitrary log tree structures. The similar extension point `%log_block` ensures that its body doesn't get executed (resp. generated) when the current runtime (resp. compile-time) log level is inadequate. Example:

 |
 |`%log_result`, `%log_printbox`, `%log_entry`, `%log_block` also allow log-level specifications (e.g. `%log2_block`).
 |
 |#### Specifying the level to log at via a runtime expression
 |
 |The unregistered extension point `[%at_log_level for_log_level; <body>]` sets the default log level for logging expressions within `<body>` to `for_log_level`, which can be any expression with integer type.
 |
 |To express the runtime-known levels to log at more concisely, we have extension points `%logN`, `%logN_result`, `%logN_printbox`, `%logN_block` (but not other extension points), by analogy to compile time levels where instead of the letter `N` there is a digit 1-9. With the letter `N`, the extension expressions take an extra argument that is the level to log at. For example, `[%logN for_log_level; "message"]` will log `"message"` when at runtime, `for_log_level`'s value is at or below the current log level.
 |
 |In particular, `[%logN_block for_log_level "header"; Printf.printf "level %d" for_log_level]` is roughly equivalent to:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=doc/sync_to_md.ml,part=at_log_level -->
 |```ocaml
+|let _get_local_debug_runtime = Minidebug_runtime.local_runtime "sync_to_md-at_log_level"
+|
+|let%debug_sexp test_at_log_level for_log_level : unit =
+|  if !Debug_runtime.log_level >= for_log_level then
+|    [%at_log_level
+|      for_log_level;
+|      [%log_entry
+|        "header";
+|        Printf.printf "level %d" for_log_level]]
+|
+|let%debug_sexp _test_at_log_level_2 : unit = test_at_log_level 2
+|let%debug_sexp _test_at_log_level_3 : unit = test_at_log_level 3
 |```
 |
 |Take a look at the test `"%logN_block runtime log levels"` in [test_expect_test.ml](test/test_expect_test.ml):
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=logN_block -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let%track_rt_sexp result ~for_log_level : int =
+|    let i = ref 0 in
+|    let j = ref 0 in
+|    while !i < 6 do
+|      incr i;
+|      [%logN_block
+|        for_log_level ("i=" ^ string_of_int !i);
+|        if !i < 3 then [%log "ERROR:", 1, "i=", (!i : int)] else ();
+|        [%log "WARNING:", 2, "i=", (!i : int)];
+|        j := (fun { contents } -> !j + contents) i;
+|        [%log3 "INFO:", 3, "j=", (!j : int)]]
+|    done;
+|    !j
+|  in
 |```
 |
 |### Lexical scopes vs. dynamic scopes
 |
 |We track lexical scoping: every log has access to the `entry_id` number of the lexical scope it is in.
 |Lexical scopes are computations: bindings, functions, tracked code branches (even if not annotated
 |with an extension point, but always within some `ppx_minidebug` registered extension point). There is
 |also dynamic scoping: which entry a particular log actually ends up belonging in. We do not
 |expose the (lexical) entry id of an individual log, except when the log "wandered" out of all dynamic
 |scopes, or you passed `~verbose_entry_ids:true` when creating a runtime. To be able to locate where such log originates from, pass `~print_entry_ids:true` when creating
 |the runtime, and look for the path line with the log's entry id. When the backend is HTML or Markdown, the entry id is a hyperlink to the anchor of the entry. Example from the test suite:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=log_with_print_entry_ids_mixed_up_scopes -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let _get_local_debug_runtime =

+|  in
+|  let i = 3 in
+|  let pi = 3.14 in
+|  let l = [ 1; 2; 3 ] in
+|  (* Messing with the structure of the logs might lead to confusing output. *)
+|  let foo1 = ref @@ fun () -> () in
+|  let foo2 = ref @@ fun () -> () in
+|  let%debug_show bar callback : unit =
+|    foo1 :=
+|      fun () ->
+|        [%log "This is like", (i : int), "or", (pi : float), "above"];
+|        [%log "tau =", (pi *. 2. : float)];
+|        callback ()
+|  in
+|  let%debug_show baz callback : unit =
+|    foo2 :=

 |```

 |`~verbose_entry_ids:true` tags all logs with entry ids, it shouldn't be needed in regular use.
 |
 |### Reducing the size of generated logs
 |
 |Summary of possibilities:
 |
 |- log levels
 |- `no_debug_if`
 |- `prune_upto`
 |- `truncate_children`
 |- `split_files_after`
 |- HTML browsers can handle really large files (less luck with Markdown).
 |
 |The log levels discussed in the previous section certainly reduce the amount generated, but they either help too little or they remove logs too indiscriminately for use in a debugging context. Dynamically controlling the runtime log level is one option, but there are some other options.
 |
 |In the PrintBox backend, you can disable the logging of specified subtrees, when the output is irrelevant, would be a distraction, or the logs take up too much space.
 |The test suite example:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=loop_changes -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let%debug_show rec loop_changes (x : int) : int =
+|    let z : int = (x - 1) / 2 in
+|    (* The call [x = 2] is not printed because it is a descendant of the no-debug call [x
+|       = 4]. *)
+|    Debug_runtime.no_debug_if (x <> 6 && x <> 2 && (z + 1) * 2 = x);
+|    if x <= 0 then 0 else z + loop_changes (z + (x / 2))
+|  in
+|  let () = print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ loop_changes 7 in
+|  [%expect
+|    {|
+|    "test/test_expect_test.ml":247:34: loop_changes

+|    │ └─z = 3

+|    │ └─loop_changes = 6
+|    └─loop_changes = 9
+|    9
+|    |}]
 |```
 |
 |The `no_debug_if` mechanism requires modifying the logged sources, and since it's limited to cutting out subtrees of the logs, it can be tricky to select and preserve the context one wants. The highlighting mechanism with the `prune_upto` setting avoids these problems. You provide a search term without modifying the debugged sources. You can tune the pruning level to keep the context around the place the search term was found.
 |
 |Setting the option `truncate_children` will only log the given number of children at each node, prioritizing the most recent ones. An example from the test suite:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=track_for_loop_truncated_children -->

 |If you provide the `split_files_after` setting, the logging will transition to a new file after the current file exceeds the given number of characters. However, the splits only happen at the "toplevel", to not interrupt laying out the log trees. If required, you can remove logging indicators from your high-level functions, to bring the deeper logic log trees to the toplevel. This matters when you prefer Markdown output over HTML output -- in my experience, Markdown renderers (VS Code Markdown Preview, GitHub Preview) fail for files larger than 2MB, while browsers easily handle HTML files of over 200MB (including via VS Code Live Preview).
 |
 |### Navigating large logs
 |
 |There are a few ways `ppx_minidebug` is helpful with large logs. You can:
 |
 |- Use the HTML backend with foldable trees. Unlike with the Markdown backend, HTML browsers can render really large files.
 |- Set `elapsed_times` to see how much time was spent in a subtree even if it is folded.
 |- Use `~time_tagged:Elapsed` to keep track of when in the course of the program particular entries are computed.
 |- Enable the _Table of Contents_ feature by e.g. passing `~with_toc_listing:true`; tune `toc_entry` so that the tables of contents are concise enough to provide an overview.
 |
 |The _table of contents_ generation is enabled via `~with_toc_listing:true` or `~toc_flame_graph:true` or both (for file-based runtimes -- via `table_of_contents_ch` for channel-based runtimes). This will create an additional file (name ending in `-toc`), mirroring the main logs in a summarized way. Selected log headers are output there preserving the tree structure, and for `~with_toc_listing:true` they look the same as in the main file except there is no folding. The headers are hyperlinks pointing to the main log file (or files, if file splitting is enabled). For `~toc_flame_graph:true`, the entries are put in boxes, like in the depicted example from the test suite. Presenting two configurations here:
 |
 |![Flame graph with paths, no time tags](docs/flame_graph_paths_no_time.png)
 |![Flame graph with values first mode, elapsed times](docs/flame_graph_values_first_elapsed.png)
 |
 |Note: if your flame graph trees run into each other, try setting `~flame_graph_separation:50` or higher.
 |
 |If you collaborate with someone or take notes, you can pass `~print_entry_ids:true`. In HTML and Markdown, this will output links to the anchors of the corresponding log entries. You can share them to point to specific log file locations.
 |

 |- When faced with a binding of a form: `let pattern = (expression : type_)`, we make use of `type_`, but we ignore all types nested inside `expression`, even if we decompose `pattern`.
 |  - For example, `let%track_sexp (x, y) = ((5, 3) : int * int)` works -- logs both `x` and `y`. Also work: `let%track_sexp ((x, y) : int * int) = (5, 3)` and `let%track_sexp ((x : int), (y : int)) = (5, 3)`. But `let%track_sexp (x, y) = ((5 : int), (3 : int))` will not log anything!
 |- We ignore record and variant datatypes when processing record and variant constructor cases. That's because there is no generic(*) way to extract the types of the arguments.
 |  - (*) Although polymorphic variant types can be provided inline, we decided it's not worth the effort supporting them.
 |  - We do handle tuple types and the builtin array type (they are not records or variants).
 |    - For example, this works: `let%track_sexp { first : int; second : int } = { first = 3; second =7 }` -- but compare with the tuple examples above, the alternatives provided above would not work for records.
 |  - Hard-coded special cases: we do decompose the option type and the list type. For example: `let%track_show f : int option -> unit = function None -> () | Some _x -> () in f (Some 3)` will log the value of `_x`.
 |- Another example of only propagating types top-down:
 |  - `let%track_show f (l : int option) : int = match l with Some y -> ...` will not log `y` when `f` is applied (but it will log `l`).
 |  - Both `let%track_show f : int option -> int = function Some y -> ...` and `let%track_show f l : int = match (l : int option) with Some y -> ...` _will_ log `y`.
 |- We try reconstructing or guessing the types of expressions logged with `%log` and `%log_result`, see details below.
 |
 |As a help in debugging whether the right type information got propagated, we offer the extension `%debug_type_info` (and `%global_debug_type_info`). (The display strips module qualifiers from types.) `%debug_type_info` is not an entry extension point (`%global_debug_type_info` is). Example [from the test suite](test/test_expect_test.ml):
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=debug_type_info -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let _get_local_debug_runtime = Minidebug_runtime.prefixed_runtime () in
+|  [%debug_show
+|    [%debug_type_info
+|      let f : 'a. 'a -> int -> int = fun _a b -> b + 1 in
+|      let g : 'a. 'a -> int -> 'a -> 'a -> int = fun _a b _c _d -> b * 2 in
+|      let () = print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ f 'a' 6 in
+|      print_endline @@ Int.to_string @@ g 'a' 6 'b' 'c']];
+|  [%expect
+|    {|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION
+|    f : int = 7
+|    ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":2242:37
+|    ├─f : int
+|    └─b : int = 6
+|    7
+|    g : int = 12
+|    ├─"test/test_expect_test.ml":2243:49
+|    ├─g : int
+|    └─b : int = 6
+|    12
+|    |}]
 |```
 |
 |You can also use at the module level: `[%%global_debug_type_info true]`, prior to the code of interest.
 |
 |Explicit logging with `%log` (and `%log_result`) has different but related restrictions compared to logging of let or argument bindings. We reconstruct the type of the expression from partial type information, where in addition to type annotations we take into account: string, int and float literals, tuple, array, list, and `lazy` expresssions. We do not analyze applications, nor constructors other than "nil" `[]` and "cons" `::` for lists. When a type is unknown, for the whole expression and for a tuple element we assume the type `string`. We don't assume string for direct subexpressions of arrays, lists, and `lazy`.
 |
 |### Dealing with concurrent execution
 |
 |With version 2.2.0, the default safety of using ppx_minidebug in a multithreaded context improved significantly. That's because the most convenient runtime builders (`local_runtime` etc.) use thread-local storage to provide local debug runtimes. They either log to different files, or use prefixes on logs. When using one of the lower-level debug runtime builders, or when using fibers or other non-system multithreading solutions, you need to be careful.
 |
 |We offer three helpers for dealing with multiple debug runtimes. 
 |
 |The default extension points `%debug_sexp`, `%track_sexp`, etc. call a function `_get_local_debug_runtime ()` and unpack the argument as `module Debug_runtime` (in a function body). The feature helps using a runtime instance dedicated to a thread or domain, since for example `_get_local_debug_runtime` can retrieve the runtime using `Domain.DLS`. (The runtime builders `local_runtime` and `local_runtime_flushing` use [`Thread_local_storage`](https://ocaml.org/p/thread-local-storage/latest).) To avoid surprises, in case of directly annotated functions, this feature unpacks a `Debug_runtime` inside the function body, so that we get the appropriate runtime for the dynamic local scope.
 |
 |There is an optional runtime instance-level setting `global_prefix`, which adds the given information to all log headers (and all logs with `prefix_all_logs`) coming from the instance. The runtime builders `prefixed_runtime` and `prefixed_runtime_flushing` use `Thread.id (Thread.self ())` in the prefixes.
 |
 |Example from the test suite:
 |
 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=track_show_procedure_runtime_prefixes -->
 |```ocaml
+|  let i = ref 0 in
+|  let _get_local_debug_runtime () =
+|    Minidebug_runtime.debug_flushing ~global_prefix:("foo-" ^ string_of_int !i) ()
+|  in
+|  let%track_show foo () =
+|    let () = () in
+|    [%log "inside foo"]
+|  in
+|  let%track_show bar = function
+|    | () ->
+|        let () = () in
+|        [%log "inside bar"]
+|  in
+|  while !i < 3 do
+|    incr i;
+|    foo ();
+|    bar ()
+|  done;
+|  [%expect
+|    {|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION foo-1
+|    foo-1 foo begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":3959:21:
+|     "inside foo"
+|    foo-1 foo end
+|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION foo-1
+|    foo-1 <function -- branch 0> () begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":3965:8:
+|     "inside bar"
+|    foo-1 <function -- branch 0> () end
+|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION foo-2
+|    foo-2 foo begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":3959:21:
+|     "inside foo"
+|    foo-2 foo end
+|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION foo-2
+|    foo-2 <function -- branch 0> () begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":3965:8:
+|     "inside bar"
+|    foo-2 <function -- branch 0> () end
+|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION foo-3
+|    foo-3 foo begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":3959:21:
+|     "inside foo"
+|    foo-3 foo end
+|
+|    BEGIN DEBUG SESSION foo-3
+|    foo-3 <function -- branch 0> () begin "test/test_expect_test.ml":3965:8:
+|     "inside bar"
+|    foo-3 <function -- branch 0> () end
+|    |}]
 |```
 |
 |Another similar feature is the extension points `%debug_rt_sexp`, `%track_rt_sexp`, etc. They add a first-class module argument to a function, and unpack the argument as `module Debug_runtime`. At present, passing of the runtime instance to functions needs to be done manually. Note that only the function attached to the `_rt_` extension point is modified.

 |<!-- $MDX file=test/test_expect_test.ml,part=track_rt_show_list_runtime_passing -->
